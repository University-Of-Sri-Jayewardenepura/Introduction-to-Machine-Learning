## Summary
Restructure the repository to make it beginner-friendly, with modular documentation, clear learning paths, and hands-on practice exercises. The aim is to help absolute beginners learn machine learning using well-organized notebooks, concise topic pages, and effective navigation.

## Goals
- Make learning paths explicit for absolute beginners.
- Break the large README into focused topic pages under docs/.
- Link each topic to hands-on notebooks in notebooks/.
- Add practice exercises for each module, with solutions.
- Provide a “How to use this repo” and “Quickstart” section.
- Add clear contribution guidelines and MIT license.
- Link to external datasets where needed.

## Proposed Structure

### 1) README overhaul
- High-level entry point with:
  - Project overview and objectives
  - Quickstart (environment setup, running notebooks)
  - Learning paths (Beginner → Intermediate, but focus on Beginner)
  - Repository structure
  - Contribution guidelines
  - License (MIT)

### 2) docs/
- Split content into topic-focused pages:
  - getting-started.md
  - data-preprocessing.md
  - regression.md
  - classification.md
  - trees-and-ensembles.md
  - unsupervised-learning.md
  - regularization-and-overfitting.md
  - Each page: “What you’ll learn”, summary, links to relevant notebooks, “Next steps”

### 3) notebooks/
- Organize all practical content:
  - intro.ipynb
  - data-cleaning.ipynb
  - iris-data-for-beginners.ipynb
  - topic-specific notebooks (e.g., regression-basics.ipynb, knn-basics.ipynb, etc.)

### 4) exercises/ and solutions/
- Add practice exercises and solutions per topic to reinforce learning.

### 5) data/
- Small datasets (e.g., iris.csv), with links to external sources for larger datasets.

### 6) src/ (optional)
- Helper code for data loading, plotting, metrics.

### 7) Navigation and Quality-of-life
- Progress Tracker in README (checkboxes for modules)
- Normalize all links, fix dead anchors
- Consider auto-generating TOCs in docs/

### 8) Contribution Guidelines
- Add clear steps for contributing (fork, branch, PR, code style, docs)
- Welcome beginner contributions

### 9) License
- Add MIT license section to README

## Tasks
- [ ] Draft new README with the proposed skeleton
- [ ] Create docs/ with initial topic pages
- [ ] Migrate content from current README into docs/
- [ ] Organize notebooks/ and link to them from docs/
- [ ] Add exercises/ and solutions/ folders
- [ ] Add/maintain data/ with links to external datasets
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Add MIT license section
- [ ] Fix all broken links, add TOCs, verify navigation

## Acceptance Criteria
- All above structure exists and is documented in README
- Docs and notebooks are accessible and linked properly
- Exercises and solutions included
- Contribution guidelines and MIT license present
